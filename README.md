# Monty Hall Game

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Monty Hall game. The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle named after the host of the American television game show "Let's Make a Deal", Monty Hall. The game involves three doors, behind one of which is a valuable prize, and behind the other two are goats. The player chooses a door, and then the host, who knows what is behind each door, opens one of the remaining doors to reveal a goat. The player is then given the option to switch their choice to the other unopened door or stick with their original choice. The goal is to maximize the chances of winning the prize.

This is how I spend my free time :)
